# Anime Eyebleach

### Project Description and Purpose

Anime Eyebleach is a React-typescript based web single-page-application designed to show you some beautiful anime inspired images to brighten up after a long day, maybe even find some new artists online that catch your eye and would like your support. 

> "After a long day of seeing what internet anonymity can do to people, you're bound to need some eye bleach."
quote by r/eyebleach.

It serves as a school study project in modern frontend practices, specifically handling asynchronous API data, local persistence, and stateful navigation.

Also the project utilizes JSONPlaceholder to simulate POST calls.

### Credentials / Mocks (if applicable)

● Authentication: The app currently uses a "Soft Login" system. No backend credentials are required; the Login.tsx page captures a username and passes it through the React Router state.

● Mock Endpoint: The Post.tsx page utilizes https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts to simulate the submission of new community images, providing a safe environment to test POST request logic.

-----

### Project Structure

The project follows a component-based architecture organized by responsibility:

    /pages: Contains top-level route components 
        (Home, Login, PopularTags, MyCollection, RandomImage, Post, PageNotFound).tsx

    /components: Reusable UI elements such as LikeButton.tsx and TagButton.tsx

    /logic: Utility files for storage management (Favorites.tsx).

    /interface: API response interface (INekosiaResponse.tsx)

-----

### List of Completed Features

[x] Tag-Based Filtering: Users can load an image by clicking on specific tag button.

[x] Random Discovery: Automatic fetching of a new image upon loading the RandomImage page.

[x] Quality Switching: Real-time toggling between high-definition (original) and optimized (compressed) images to save bandwidth.

[x] Favorites System: Persistent image viewing using localStorage that allows users to "Like" images and view them later in myCollection.

[x] Dynamic Routing: Implementation of "protected-style navigation" where the myCollection page requires a username from the Login page.

[x] Optimized Fetching: Integration of tan-stack-query to handle caching and prevent redundant API calls when the window is minimized.

-----

### Known issues

[ ] The Login state doesn't persist after changing upon change of route, so every time the user enters myCollection it redirects them to the Login page.

### About me: 

Hello there, I am Chris, italian "programmer" moving its first steps in react based environments. 

After an _INCREADIBLY_ failed attempt at a d&d character creation react SPA I decided to change the already broken ship's course to this project after scrolling through the free APIs list. 

Now after basically two weeks and two failed BG3 Honour Mode campaigns, I can release this project that I am proud of.

So if you scrolled this far and read the entirety of the README, first of: what the hell are you doing, nobody reads this, go find something better to do/better GitHub projects to use; 

second of all: thank you for your attention and have a wonderful day.

Chris.
